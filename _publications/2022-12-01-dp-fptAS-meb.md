This paper presents a linear-time fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Minimum Enclosing Ball problem under differential privacy. We provide utilityâ€“privacy tradeoffs with near-optimal dependence on accuracy and dimension, and validate the approach with experiments on synthetic and real datasets.
